# Project_ColdHeart

This game was a initially a game that I made for the 2022
GameDev.tv Game Jam. However, because of build issues and
various game-breaking bugs, I was unable to publish the 
game. Despite all of that, I decide to continue development 
since I feel this game has potential. 

Edit:
I haven't finish this game. My laptop is slow and I'm 
getting a real desktop computer. I will be back to working 
on this project again!
